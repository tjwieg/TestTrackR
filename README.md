# TestTrackR
An attempt to port "Track Test" from Fortran90 to R. 

NOTICE: This project is abandoned. Feel free to fork and pick up where I left off. Unfortunately the URL in TestTrackR.R for the original Fortran90 source code is a dead link now. The program can now be found at [Mendeley Data](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/cv4jbb2ds6) instead.
